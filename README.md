# EV3-HuskyLens-Stuff
An adapter (ardunio based) allow HuskyLens communication with LEGO Mindstroms EV3 (support SPIKE/RI).

## How it works
The EV3 using UART protocol to communicate with sensors, and SPIKE Prime/Robot Inventor(Powered Up devices) using same protocol with some new extensions. So that we can build a simple adapter to connect sensors and EV3.
